# php-openssl-cryptor

## Description

This is a fork of https://github.com/ioncube/php-openssl-cryptor git repo. This
is the same code, but I rearranged it and made it into a composer package. I wanted
to use it with my other composer code, and so it made sense to make this fork.

You can install this package using composer like this.

`composer require hack3r3d/php-openssl-cryptor`

The packagist for this library is located here.

Simple to use class for encrypting/decrypting using the PHP Openssl library. 

The Cryptor class supports arbitrary encryption and key hashing algorithms, along
with raw, base64 and hex encoding of the encrypted data. Static convenience methods
are provided for the default of AES, but a cryptor instance can be used for more
flexibility. The default uses aes-256-ctr to avoid the need for padding and the related
issues. Unfortunately GCM cannot be used as the PHP openssl module does not provide 
a way to retrieve the GCM tag. This is proposed to be remedied in PHP 7.1 when 
associated data can be retrieved.

## Example
```php
use Crypto\Cryptor;

$data = 'Good things come in small packages.';
$key = '9901:io=[<>602vV03&Whb>9J&M~Oq';

$encrypted = Cryptor::Encrypt($data, $key);

echo "'$data' (" . strlen($data) . ") => '$encrypted'\n\n";

$decrypted = Cryptor::Decrypt($encrypted, $key);

echo "'$encrypted' => '$decrypted' (" . strlen($decrypted) . ")\n";
```
